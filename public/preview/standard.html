  <p>{:index=>"A fascinating medieval atmosphere envelops Lamu’s archipelago, which has not changed much in looks and character during the centuries. Made up of a chain of major islands and many smaller ones, this archipelago is the brightest jewel of the Kenya coast, and offers an unforgettable stay for those seeking to get away from it all. Here life flows at a slow and relaxed pace; the enchanting landscape is characterized by sand dunes, long white beaches and small hidden villages.\n\nThe old town of Lamu, recognized by Unesco as a World Heritage Site, is a rare living fragment of the Swahili culture, which once dominated the whole coast on the Indian Ocean With its winding streets, which allow passage only to people and donkeys, the typical wooden carvings and the characteristic architecture of its houses, it is absolutely charming.\n", :villas=>"Located on the fantastic Manda Island’s beach, a few meters from the sea, and surrounded by luxurious tropical vegetation, Equator and Blue Empire villas enjoy a spectacular view of the Indian Ocean, the island of Lamu and the charming Shela village.\nBuilt with precious African woods and tastefully designed in a refined exotic style, they are characterized by the traditional roof in makuti with braided palm leaves and by wide verandas on the sea from which one can enjoy unforgettable sunsets.

Menus can be adapted to suit our guests’ tastes.\n\nEach villa has also a dhow, local wooden boat, with a captain, who will welcome you at the airport and will stay at your complete disposal for the duration of your stay, leading you to the discovery of idyllic places.We also have a beautiful, Mozambique-styled dhow, which guests can hire for unforgettable trips.\n\nThanks to their invaluable position on the beach, with stunning, romantic views on the Indian Ocean, Equator and Blue Empire are the ideal location for wedding parties, honeymoons, and other events.\n", :activities=>"Among the islands of the archipelago, the main means of transport is the traditional dhow, and the excursions by dhow are one of the must of any visit to Lamu.\n\nWe can organize half day trips with a picnic lunch, or you can sail in the bay or in the mangrove channels in the late afternoon to enjoy the sunset while sipping a cocktail.\n\nYou can snorkel on the coral reefs off Manda Toto island and discover an astounding array of exotic marine wildlife; visit the ruins at Takwa, the remains of a thriving Swahili trading town, or the villages of Kipungani and Matondoni; explore the narrow streets of Lamu Town with its ancient fort, museum, wood carvers and donkeys; swim across the channel to Shela Village; go for a stroll along white deserted beaches.\n\nDeep sea or hand line fishing can also be arranged, as well as water sports like windsurfing, kitesurfing, wakeboarding, water-skiing, laser sailing and kayaking.
