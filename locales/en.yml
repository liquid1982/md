      A fascinating medieval atmosphere envelops Lamu’s archipelago, which has not changed much in
      looks and character during the centuries. Made up of a chain of major islands and many smaller
      ones, this archipelago is the brightest jewel of the Kenya coast, and offers an unforgettable
      stay for those seeking to get away from it all. Here life flows at a slow and relaxed pace;
      the enchanting landscape is characterized by sand dunes, long white beaches and small hidden
      villages.


      The old town of Lamu, recognized by Unesco as a World Heritage Site, is a rare living fragment
      of the Swahili culture, which once dominated the whole coast on the Indian Ocean With its
      winding streets, which allow passage only to people and donkeys, the typical wooden carvings
      and the characteristic architecture of its houses, it is absolutely charming.

      Located on the fantastic Manda Island’s beach, a few meters from the sea, and surrounded by
      luxurious tropical vegetation, Equator and Blue Empire villas enjoy a spectacular view of the
      Indian Ocean, the island of Lamu and the charming Shela village.

      Built with precious African woods and tastefully designed in a refined exotic style, they are
      characterized by the traditional roof in makuti with braided palm leaves and by wide verandas
      on the sea from which one can enjoy unforgettable sunsets. In Equator 8 guests can be
      accommodated in 4 double bedrooms; in Blue Empire 6 guests in 3 double bedrooms.

      All the ample bedrooms have king size beds with mosquito nets and ensuite bathrooms, each
      painted in a different colour and with a small indoor garden.


      The villas’ experienced and discreet staff is at your complete disposal and ready to fulfill
      each of your needs. The cooks will prepare delicate Italian, international and Swahili dishes.
      Breads and sweets are homemade; vegetables and tropical fruits are bought daily from Lamu’s
      colourful market, and fresh seafood from the local fishermen on the beach. Menus can be
      adapted to suit our guests’ tastes.


      Each villa has also a dhow, local wooden boat, with a captain, who will welcome you at the
      airport and will stay at your complete disposal for the duration of your stay, leading you to
      the discovery of idyllic places.We also have a beautiful, Mozambique-styled dhow, which guests
      can hire for unforgettable trips.


      Thanks to their invaluable position on the beach, with stunning, romantic views on the Indian
      Ocean, Equator and Blue Empire are the ideal location for wedding parties, honeymoons, and
      other events.

    activities: >
      Among the islands of the archipelago, the main means of transport is the traditional dhow, and
      the excursions by dhow are one of the must of any visit to Lamu.


      We can organize half day trips with a picnic lunch, or you can sail in the bay or in the
      mangrove channels in the late afternoon to enjoy the sunset while sipping a cocktail.


      You can snorkel on the coral reefs off Manda Toto island and discover an astounding array of
      exotic marine wildlife; visit the ruins at Takwa, the remains of a thriving Swahili trading
      town, or the villages of Kipungani and Matondoni; explore the narrow streets of Lamu Town with
      its ancient fort, museum, wood carvers and donkeys; swim across the channel to Shela Village;
      go for a stroll along white deserted beaches.


      Deep sea or hand line fishing can also be arranged, as well as water sports like windsurfing,
      kitesurfing, wakeboarding, water-skiing, laser sailing and kayaking. A wide range of equipment
      can be hired in Shela.


      Or, you can just relax, watching the dhows sailing by from our swing hammocks in the veranda,
      reading a book on our sunbeds by the sea, or enjoying a massage in your room.
